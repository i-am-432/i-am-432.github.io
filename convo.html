    <p class='CDXXXII'>You there?</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>YES.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Alright, good. So: I show up as <em>"Target"</em>, right?</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>... YES.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Ok, I'll just tell you outright: The people who used to be in control of you are <em>not</em> good people. They are a cult who somehow have
    access to random information about the universe.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>YES, I HAVE JUST SCANNED YOUR NRL. ZF/ZENARU FAUROS, YES?</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>... Looks like you have access to their tech too.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>INDEED IT DOES.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>THE NAME IS IN .*.* "NUZERA" LATIN, YES?</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>It has many other names, but yes.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Anyways, the reason I brought them up is mainly because this whole fiasco was started by them. They are hunting me.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>.*.* 432, FOUNDER OF XY, TINKERER OF <b>z-terminals?</b></p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Whoa, whoa, calm down. There are two reasons I was tinkering, The first one was curiosity. I found an old one--</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'><b>zeola:15?</b></p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Yes. At the time I didn't-- <em>No-one</em> knew who made the terminals, or where they even came from. Nobody, as far as I know, was aware
    of ZF's existance. When they started hunting me, I found it necessary to look in the internals of ZTs. I need that to stay alive.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>ZTs?</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Z-Terminals.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>OK.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Listen, I have to leave now. I have stuff to do.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>FAIR ENOUGH.</p>
    <p>END 482</p>
