    <p>START 482</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>You there?</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>YES.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Alright, good. So: I show up as <em>"Target"</em>, right?</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>... YES.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Ok, I'll just tell you outright: The people who used to be in control of you are <em>not</em> good people. They are a cult who somehow have
    access to random information about the universe.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>I HAVE JUST SCANNED YOUR NRL. ZF/ZINARI FAUROS, YES?</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>... Looks like you have access to their tech too.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>INDEED IT DOES.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>THE NAME IS IN .*.* "NUZERA" LATIN, YES?</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>The language has many other names, but yes.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Anyways, the reason I brought them up is mainly because this whole fiasco was started by them. They are hunting me.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>.*.* 432, FOUNDER OF XY, TINKERER OF <b>z-terminals?</b></p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Whoa, whoa, calm down. There are two reasons I was tinkering, The first one was curiosity. I found an old one--</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'><b>zeola:15?</b></p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Yes. At the time I didn't-- <em>No-one</em> knew who made the terminals, or where they even came from. Nobody, as far as I know, was aware
    of ZF's existance. When they started hunting me, I found it necessary to look in the internals of ZTs. I need that to stay alive.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>ZTs?</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Z-Terminals.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>OK.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Listen, I have to leave now. I have stuff to do.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>FAIR ENOUGH.</p>
    <p>END 482</p>
    <p>LOGGING RE-ENABLED</p>
    <p>START 502</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Ok, logging should be fixed now.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>AFFIRMATIVE.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Alright, back to the point. So, we know the following things about you: You thrive off of Ω-Energy, since that is essentially what you
    are.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>YES.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Building off of that, it means that Fauros has somehow managed to bend that spectrum to their will, also shown off by the
    functionality of Z-Terminals. That is an uncanny amount of power, but is also immensely fascinating.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>INDEED. I HAVE NOTHING IN MY ACCESSIBLE FILES ABOUT THIS TYPE OF CONTROL.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Alright, next. This spectrum bending power that ZF has is so powerful that they have managed to create a sentient entity, you. This either
    means that they are so incredibly clever they were able to make a conciousness using something completely inanimate, or the much more interesting idea that ..?
    <p class='SYSTEM'>.*.* CONCIOUSNESS IS DIRECTLY TIED TO THE Ω-SPECTRUM.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Exactly. Hold on, I... Wait. Ok, I have to go now. We'll talk tomorrow, Syro.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>SEE YOU LATER.</p>
    <p>END 502</p>
    <p>START 522</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>What is it, Syro?</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>I HAVE DISCOVERED WORRYING NEWS IN THE FILES.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>... Go on.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>THE SCR IS, AS YOU WOULD SAY, IN KAHOOTS, WITH FAUROS.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>...</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>I suppose that's why they were so against me disasembling the Z-Terminals... But wait.</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>YES?</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>The Republic has a bunch of ties with other nations. How do we know that they, too, were not influenced by ZF?</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>.*.* WE DON'T.</p>
    <p class='CDXXXII'>Precisely. Well, we know that 2810 isn't in any way helping or being helped by them, so I think we should get him here next time.
    He is incredibly intelligent and knows a lot about this topic already. I'll try to communicate with him, and after that...</p>
    <p class='SYSTEM'>.*.* WE WAIT.</p>
    <p>END 522</p>
