    <h1>I am 432.</h1>
    <p>I am a number. But not just any number. I founded the XY Syndicate. I am the first recorded person to break into a Z-Terminal, and that leads onto me being hunted.
      Yeah. I'm not sure if I'm alive by the time you read this. If all goes well, then hopefully yes.</p>
    
    <h3>Strange readings?</h3>
    <p class="post">160 has mentioned something deeply worrying to me. <em>Strange numerical readings</em>.</br>The reason this worries me is because
      I felt very strange around ZEOLA:015. It must have been emitting some sort of radiation. I'm not a science expert, so I don't know exactly what
      the radiation <em><does/em>, but what I do know is that it is not good. And if similar things are being reported from the territory of XY...
      </br>The organisation must have activated something remotely in those Z-Terminals. I think they are attempting to target XY specifically
      because I am the founder.</br></br><em>They want to see me suffer.</em></p>
    
    <h3>Test</h3>
