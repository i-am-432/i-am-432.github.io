    <h1>I am 432.</h1>
    <p>I am a number. But not just any number. I founded the XY Syndicate. I am the first recorded person to break into a Z-Terminal, and that leads onto me being hunted.
      Yeah. I'm not sure if I'm alive by the time you read this. If all goes well, then hopefully yes.</p>

    <h3>Do not trust my Z-Log account.</h3>
    <p class="post">Whatever you might think, my Z-Log account is not to be trusted. <b>EVER.</b> Everything past Z-456-ZF should be ignored. <em>I do not use the account
      anymore.</em> The misinformation that the Organisation could be spreading on that account could be an active threat if misinterpreted. Also, as far as I'm aware,
      the Organisation has full control over Z-Net. They could be planting mind control data or something for all I know.</p>
    <p class="post">My point is, this site is the only reliable source of information from me, apart from my real self. Although, from the soul preservation doohickery
      of the Blazing Star, even that could be compromised at some point.</p>
    
    <h3>Strange readings?</h3>
    <p class="post">160 has mentioned something deeply worrying to me. <em>Strange numerical readings</em>.</br>The reason this worries me is because
      I felt very strange around ZEOLA:015. It must have been emitting some sort of radiation. I'm not a science expert, so I don't know exactly what
      the radiation <em>does</em>, but what I do know is that it is not good. And if similar things are being reported from the territory of XY...
      </br>The organisation must have activated something remotely in those Z-Terminals. I think they are attempting to target XY specifically
      because I am the founder.</br></br><em>They want to see me suffer.</em></p>
    
    <h3>Test</h3>
    <p class="post">Hey. This is a test for making a post. It's mostly a thing for myself to see if the hosting works. Alright, see ya.</p>
