    <h1>Be aware.</h1>
    <p><em>They</em> have found this site. All I know is that their systems are automated, so I can do some trickery here and there. I will probably
    have to make a few diversion blogs so that the systems don't get too much from me. This is the first of these diversions.</p>
    
    <h3>Welcome back.</h3>
    <p class="post">I am making progress. I have multiple areas of interest where I could get hold of an old Z-Terminal, so I can keep inspecting. I've

    network tunnel to an old terminal but I have thing prioratised in front of that.</p>
