    <h1>Be aware.</h1>
    <p><em>They</em> have found this site. All I know is that their systems are automated, so I can do some trickery here and there. I will probably
    have to make a few diversion blogs so that the systems don't get too much from me. This is the first of these diversions.</p>
    
    <h3>The system is stupid.</h3>
    <p class='post'>Seriously? "Thanks for understanding" my ass. Listen, ZF, are you clever or stupid? Make up your mind! Alright, to the point. I've found another
    Z-Terminal! I still have the tunneling code on my laptop. If you have found a server that can host Python sockets for free, then please tell me at <a href="mailto:432of.xy@gmail.com">my email</a>.
    I would me infinitely thankful. Also, if you happen to come across an old ZT of your own, do the following:</br>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the X78 Screw in the bottom left corner on the side with the logo on it</li>
      <li>Look for a cyan-lime circuit board inside the Terminal</li>
      <li>Flick switches "ZL", "GI", and "LU" to the off position</li>
    </ul>
    </br>The old models tend to have their power switches jammed or obscured. Unjamming one is as simple as cleaning the gunk underneath it.
    As for actually finding the switch, you'll find that there are quite a lot of different ones. The one you need is the red one, but you would have guessed that
    anyways.</p>
    <p class='post'>Some of you may be confused as to why we need the old terminals specifically, and here's a simple explanation: Protection. Two types of it.
    First, your own. The old ones have a much weaker logging system that was only updated after around the 500th manufacture. Second, the code's. The newer
    Terminals won't just let you peek at the code with no restriction. They check for your number, and only if it's one of the devs, it will let you unlock the code.
    The original terminals were marketed as partly open source, and they kept their promise.</p>
    <p class='post'>To look into the code of a pre-500 terminal, you need to flick the "EJ" switch on the cyan-lime circuit board. The code cartridge will
    then be ejected. This can be plugged into any modern computer and will work like an SD Card. As a side note, this could mean running custom code on the
    terminals, which could allow for games, or, even more important, scanning the system for functions. This is big. Insanely so.</p>
    <p class='post'>Anyways, this was a long post. I hope this helped the people with pre-500s to explore the mystery. Don't forget the Zl, GI and LU switches.
    I did, and now am being hunted.</p>

    <h3>Welcome back.</h3>
    <p class="post">I am making progress. I have multiple areas of interest where I could get hold of an old Z-Terminal, so I can keep inspecting. I've
    learn't my lesson with this: turn off logging, global internet and anything that could lend <em>them</em> access to my location. I really want to create a new
    network tunnel to an old terminal but I have things prioritised in front of that.</p>
